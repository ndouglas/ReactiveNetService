ReactiveNetService
==================

Additions to the NSNetService/NSNetServiceBrowser ecosystem for greater interoperability with ReactiveCocoa.

This is largely based on Chris Devereux's [ReactiveNetService](https://github.com/chrisdevereux/ReactiveNetService), but adds some more convenience methods, handles TXT record updates, and so forth.  I started with Chris' work but spent enough time hacking around issues with my (admittedly strange) usage scenarios that I wanted to create a distinct project rather than pollute his project with my weird edge cases :)
